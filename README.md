Modding library for the Taiko games

## How to compile
1. Install [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or later. Make sure to install .NET 4.7.2 Targeting Pack. <br>
2. Press Build > Build Solution.

## Advices
The code is currently in its initial phase and it's very unoptimized.<br>
As of 04.05.2021 it's been some time since I compiled it for the last time. Some code may be broken or unfinished. 

## To-do
* Finish DatabaseEditor <br>
* Research other generation's FUMEN format <br>
* Implement TJA support on ScriptEditor <br>
* Organize & optimize the code <br>
* Create a wiki page for tools documentation
